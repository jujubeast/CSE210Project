Database Configuration

Right now, I (Hanbo) is using my own MySQL server for local development. So I checked in my own database.hanbo.yml to source depo.
When I run the server, I will first copy my yml and replace the existing one, then start the server. When I am done, I will revert
the changes using GIT.

To install existing schema:
1. You must run this in Apatana Studio
2. Run: rake db:schema:load
   The command will install the tables defined in db/schema.rb into the database server.
3. Once done, check the MySQL DB and find the tables available inside.
